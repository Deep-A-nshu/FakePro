# FakeCall Pro

A discrete mobile app that generates realistic incoming calls to help users escape awkward situations, avoid unwanted conversations, or create believable interruptions. Built with Expo and React Native.

## Features

- Instant fake call trigger with a prominent Call Now button
- Schedule calls 1–60 minutes in the future
- Customize caller name, number, photo URL, message, and placeholder voice
- Quick templates for common scenarios (Boss, Doctor, Family, Delivery)
- Simulated call screen with Decline/Answer options
- All data stored locally on device

## Development

### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Run the app
```bash
npx expo start
```
Press `a` for Android, `i` for iOS, or `w` for web.

### Lint

npm run lint
```

## Notes
This is an early implementation. Text‑to‑speech, image picker, and persistent storage are placeholders and require additional modules.
